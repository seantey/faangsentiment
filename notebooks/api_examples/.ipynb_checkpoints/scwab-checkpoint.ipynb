Despite the fact that its Fremont, California plant was shut down from March 23 - May 17, the electric car maker still produced 82,272 vehicles, down a modest 4.5% yr/yr.<br><br>The uncertain economic times and volatility in the markets has done little to cool demand. For the quarter, TSLA delivered 90,650 vehicle, cruising past the ~74K consensus estimate. Additionally, the company actually delivered more Model 3 and Model Y's in Q2 (80,050) compared to Q1 (76,200).<br><br>The key catalyst for TSLA's recent success hinges on soaring sales for its less-expensive Model 3 car in China. In May, TSLA sold 11,095 Model 3s in China, more than tripling the number sold in April.<br><br>The company was able to achieve that stellar growth because its Shanghai production facility was only closed for a couple weeks in January and February. This allowed TSLA to meet the rising demand in China, which is being fueled by a couple different factors.<br><br>After a prolonged slump, the auto market in China is finally recovering, registering its first month-over-month sales increase in May (+1.9%) in nearly a year.Â\\xa0Electric vehicles (EVs) in particular are experiencing a surge in sales, evidenced by the 179% jump in June deliveries that China-based NIO (NIO) reported this morning.<br><br>The Chinese government is very supportive of the EV market, seeking to grow the share of new EV vehicles to 25% over the next five years. To help reach that goal, subsidies and tax incentives that were set to expire this year were extended to 2022. Furthermore, the government implemented a 2.7 bln yuan stimulus injection for battering charging equipment.<br><br>This positive business climate in China provides TSLA with a long runway for growth, which is a main reason why Wedbush raised its TSLA price target today to $1,250 from $1,000, while noting the bull case now stands at $2,000.<br><br><br><br>\",\n",
