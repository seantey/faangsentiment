# Docker-airflow uses the sequential executor by default which does not parallelize the tasks
# Instead we will use the local executor which does have parallel task execution but all on the same machine.
# We may change to using the Celery executor in the future to run on multiple machines.

# On your local machine, you might want to set up a SSH tunnel to map the Airflow Server UI to localhost.

# Run this locally to map the localhost:8080 on the remote machine (which maps to a server in the container)
# to your port 8080

# ssh -i /path/to/key -N -L 8080:localhost:8080 user@yourserver.com

# The terminal should be blank after the command but going to 0.0.0.0:8080 or localhost:8080 should show the UI.
